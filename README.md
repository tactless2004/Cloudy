Simple Weather App


### Roadmap

**Weather API**

- [ ] Geocoding interface for resolving addresses

- [ ] Improve data available from Weather objects

Currently, the weather API only offers temperature and wind direction. In the future, I will add Precipitation%, Humidity%, and short weather info like "partly cloudy".
